          <p>With a remarkable replacement likelihood of over 96% and a
            surprising growth ratio of almost 7%, it doesnâ€™t mean that this
            job is safe from automation. As the business organizations are
            enlarging their businesses and prospects, automated benefit and
            compensation management systems will save a lot of time and efforts.
            These automated systems are currently gaining popularity and are
            being adopted by some huge business organizations to provide their
            employees with promised benefits and compensations.</p>
