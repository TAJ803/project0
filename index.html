      <h1> 12 JOBS THAT WILL BE SOON REPLACED BY AI </h1>

      <p>Computerization of human lives was the beginning of the end of all
      the traditional methods and non-automated devices. Ever since the
      evolution of computers and the introduction of automation the human
      lives have gone through drastic changes. Considering how many
      technological advances have impacted our lives, one can say that there
      is no limit to technological advancements. In the beginning, computers
      astounded the whole world and now AI. The term “Artificial Intelligence”
      has a very broad meaning. computer intelligenceOne can easily define AI
      as human-like computers. The computers or devices which can mimic
      human-like movements and can perform functions in a much better and
      more efficient way than humans. From integral mobile apps like SIRI to
      surgical robots, AI has not widened the perspectives of automation, but
      it has redefined what completion automation means. The AI technology of
      this era is focused on enabling the machines on doing a single task like
      driving a car or performing facial recognition or home automation. Even
      though this automation was considered impractical few decades ago but
      all credits to AI the human generation surpassed its own expectations
      and possibilities. The scientists are striving to make AI stronger; a
      technology that will supersede human intelligence and efficiency at
      nearly every task humans can do. </p>

      <h2>How will AI impact the employment sector?</h2>

      <p>One of the most controversial topic when it comes to artificial
      intelligence is how the future of AI will impact humanity. There are
      tons of controversies that are being discussed by the AI experts and
      professionals. One of the most prophesied controversies about AI is
      that this rapid development in technology will soon reduce the employment
      opportunities to none. Does this myth ring any bells? Well, it is the same
      prophecy that many people used to believe in when computers were
      introduced in the corporate world. Not only do computers increased the
      job opportunities instead it also helped in improving human efficiency
      and performance.
      Same is the case with artificial intelligence. The employment of AI is
      not restricted to only checking the baggage at assembly lines rather AI
      is outperforming the humans in many other sectors like marketing, sales,
      and analysis.
      It will be unreasonable to say that AI will not replace any job and will
      make jobs easier and better for humans. The truth lies in the midway of
      both these approaches, in some approaches AI will make jobs and tasks
      easier and simpler for humans while on the other hand robots and AI
      machines will replace humans.
      However, this doesn’t pose any threat to any human employment. Automation
      is the real essence of the AI revolution and potentially. Not all careers
      will be destroyed, the robotic takeover of several jobs also means the
      opening of new job opportunities in advanced technology.
      Several studies and researches have been conducted on the jobs which have
      a higher chance of getting replaced by AI machines, robots, and other
      automated devices. In this article, we present you with a comprehensive
      enlistment of jobs and professions that will be fully computerized in a
      few decades. Based on the nature, type and amount of training required
      for these jobs, AI machines are most likely to perform these jobs in the
      coming years:</p>
