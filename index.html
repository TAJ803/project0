      <h1> JOBS THAT WILL BE SOON REPLACED BY AI </h1>

      <p>Computerization of human lives was the beginning of the end of all
      the traditional methods and non-automated devices. Ever since the
      evolution of computers and the introduction of automation the human
      lives have gone through drastic changes. Considering how many
      technological advances have impacted our lives, one can say that there
      is no limit to technological advancements. In the beginning, computers
      astounded the whole world and now AI. The term “Artificial Intelligence”
      has a very broad meaning. computer intelligenceOne can easily define AI
      as human-like computers. The computers or devices which can mimic
      human-like movements and can perform functions in a much better and
      more efficient way than humans. From integral mobile apps like SIRI to
      surgical robots, AI has not widened the perspectives of automation, but
      it has redefined what completion automation means. The AI technology of
      this era is focused on enabling the machines on doing a single task like
      driving a car or performing facial recognition or home automation. Even
      though this automation was considered impractical few decades ago but
      all credits to AI the human generation surpassed its own expectations
      and possibilities. The scientists are striving to make AI stronger; a
      technology that will supersede human intelligence and efficiency at
      nearly every task humans can do. </p>

      <h2>How will AI impact the employment sector?</h2>

      <p>One of the most controversial topic when it comes to artificial
      intelligence is how the future of AI will impact humanity. There are
      tons of controversies that are being discussed by the AI experts and
      professionals. One of the most prophesied controversies about AI is
      that this rapid development in technology will soon reduce the employment
      opportunities to none. Does this myth ring any bells? Well, it is the same
      prophecy that many people used to believe in when computers were
      introduced in the corporate world. Not only do computers increased the
      job opportunities instead it also helped in improving human efficiency
      and performance.
      Same is the case with artificial intelligence. The employment of AI is
      not restricted to only checking the baggage at assembly lines rather AI
      is outperforming the humans in many other sectors like marketing, sales,
      and analysis.
      It will be unreasonable to say that AI will not replace any job and will
      make jobs easier and better for humans. The truth lies in the midway of
      both these approaches, in some approaches AI will make jobs and tasks
      easier and simpler for humans while on the other hand robots and AI
      machines will replace humans.
      However, this doesn’t pose any threat to any human employment. Automation
      is the real essence of the AI revolution and potentially. Not all careers
      will be destroyed, the robotic takeover of several jobs also means the
      opening of new job opportunities in advanced technology.
      Several studies and researches have been conducted on the jobs which have
      a higher chance of getting replaced by AI machines, robots, and other
      automated devices. In this article, we present you with a comprehensive
      enlistment of jobs and professions that will be fully computerized in a
      few decades. Based on the nature, type and amount of training required
      for these jobs, AI machines are most likely to perform these jobs in the
      coming years:</p>

      <h2> What jobs will be replaced by Artificial Intelligence? </h2>

      <li> <a href="Telemarketers.html "> Telemarketers </a> </li>
      <li> <a href="BookkeepingClerks.html "> Bookkeeping Clerks </a> </li>

      <li> <a href="SecurityGuard.html "> Security Guard </a> </li>
      </ol>

      <h2> There are some othere fileds, those will get effected by AI </h2>
      <Ul>
        <li>Transportation: Although it could take a decade or more to perfect
          them, autonomous cars will one day ferry us from place to place.</li>
        <li>Manufacturing: AI powered robots work alongside humans to perform a
          limited range of tasks like assembly and stacking, and predictive
          analysis sensors keep equipment running smoothly. </li>
        <li>Healthcare: In the comparatively AI-nascent field of healthcare,
          diseases are more quickly and accurately diagnosed, drug discovery is
          sped up and streamlined, virtual nursing assistants monitor patients
          and big data analysis helps to create a more personalized patient
          experience. </li>
        <li>Education: Textbooks are digitized with the help of AI, early-stage
          virtual tutors assist human instructors and facial analysis gauges the
          emotions of students to help determine who’s struggling or bored and
          better tailor the experience to their individual needs. </li>
      </UL>

      <h2> Conclusion </h2>
      <p>The impacts of artificial intelligence on human lives cannot be neglected.
      Some experts of fear that such rapid growth in AI might bring about
      drastic consequences on humanity while others have a completely opposite
      take on this rapid development in AI. Nobody is completely sure about what
      the future of AI holds for the coming human generations, but considering
      the human capabilities to learn, to adapt, to self-educate— it is safe to
      say that human beings are bound to bring about more rapid and successful
      changes in the world.</p>
