          <p>Automated phoning and scheduling systems have the potential to
            replace the role of a receptionist. The possibility of
            computerization and automation of this role is nearly 96%. Most of
            the multinational companies and huge business organizations which
            donâ€™t have an office-wide telephoning system are going for these
            automated systems.</p>
