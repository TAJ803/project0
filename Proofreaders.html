          <p>Proofreading applications and software are used almost every
            blogging site. With a replacement probability of almost 84%, this
            job will soon be done only by automated software in the next few
            years. There are now self-checking writing tools and applications
            that not only helps in checking and detecting grammatical errors
            rather it also detect plagiarism and corrects the sentence
            structures.</p>
