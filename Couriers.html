          <p>In the next few years, your delivery-boy will no longer have a
            human form. Drones and robotic devices are rapidly taking over the
            courier and delivery services. The expectancy of a robotic takeover
            is increased by an astonishing 5%. It only a matter of time that
            this job will be fully automated. </p>
